for determining which udev functions and extensions extensions are supported
on the target platform.

LIMITATIONS

- udev_device_get_parent_with_subsystem_devtype() need to be merged to a single
  line in the geader before generating the wrangler with stubs support
- udev_set_log_fn() is not included into the stubs at all.
