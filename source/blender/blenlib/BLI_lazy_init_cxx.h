 * These macros help to define functions that should only be
 * executed once to initialize some data. The initialized data
 * will only be freed when Blender quits.
 *
 * Requirements:
 *   - Very simple usage, without exposing the implementation details.
 *   - No additional heap allocation for every lazy initialized piece of data.
 *   - Blender has to be able to free all lazy-initialized data shortly
 *     before it quits. This is to make Blenders leak detection not detect
 *     false positives. It would, when we would just depend on static variables.
 *     These are destructed, after Blender prints non-freed memory blocks.
