- Some types can have multiple owners and are reference counted.
    - Function
    - Type
    - DataFlowGraph
    - TupleMeta

- Function bodies are owned by a single function.
- A function can have multiple bodies.
- A function can have at most one body of a certain type.

- Type extensions are owned by a single type.
- A type can have multiple extensions.
- A type can have at most one extensions of a certain type.

Inside a tuple call:
    - A tuple call body can modify fn_in and fn_out.
    - The underlying tuple buffers are owned by the caller and might be freed any time after the function finished.
    - When a tuple is freed, all initialized values in it are freed.
    - A tuple call body has to initialize all values in fn_out.
    - fn_out might already contain initialized values on entry.
