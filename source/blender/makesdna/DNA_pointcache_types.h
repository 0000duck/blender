					 * plane (with high damping) they quickly come to a stop on the plane, however there are still
					 * forces acting on the particle (gravity and collisions), so the particle velocity isn't necessarily
					 * zero for the whole duration of the frame even if the particle seems stationary. If all simulation
					 * frames aren't cached (step > 1) these velocities are interpolated into movement for the non-cached
					 * frames. The result will look like the point is oscillating around the collision location. So for
					 * now cache step should be set to 1 for accurate reproduction of collisions.
